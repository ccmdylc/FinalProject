# FinalProject

Data cleaning/analysis of the USDA My Food Pyramid database. The purpose of this study is to help trainers or dietitians who want to optimize their clients diets to fit their needs. Some might need a higher caloric intake, while reducing fat, while others might want to avoid oils. My analysis will provide them with foods that fit these categories which can be added or removed from a diet if needed.


#### Questions to be Answered
##### What are the foods/drinks with the highest calories from alcohol?
##### What foods/drinks have the highest calories from fruit content?
##### What foods/drinks with the lowest saturated fat count have the highest calorie count?
##### What foods/drinks have the most calories from oils?
